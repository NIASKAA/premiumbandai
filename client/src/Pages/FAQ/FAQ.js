                    What are Premium-Bandai's Gunpla?

                <p className="text">
                    Premium-Bandai's Gunpla are exclusive Gunplas that can only be ordered online through the 
                    official Premium-Bandai website that is dedicated for your region.

                    What does this website do?
                </h3>
                <p className="text">
                    This website was made solely for anyone to keep track of their inventory of Premium-Bandai. As a
                    Gunpla Collector myself, I find it harder to check for specific exclusives so I made this for everyone
                    to use. You can save the Gunpla you already owned or you can put it in your wishlist. Mobile App version
                    coming soon!

                    About Gundam Expos and Gundam Base Limited...

                    You might wonder why those aren't included in the list. Well, those aren't Premium-Bandai's exclusives.
                    The problem is that those kind of exclusives are only available when you buy in store. (Not including secondhand)
                    There are a few exceptions to the few Gunpla's that were made available to Premium-Bandai, those are included.
