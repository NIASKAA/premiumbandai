# premiumbandai
A web application that lets users save what premium bandai items they own and also put items they want into their wishlist.
This application was created solely on a life problem I've encountered. With the ever increasing premium bandai being released, it got harder to keep track of what and when Gunpla are coming out. This application solves all of that. Each users can create an account to keep track of these things.
